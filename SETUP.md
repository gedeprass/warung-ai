```

### 2. Database Setup

Start the PostgreSQL database:

```bash
# Start the database using Docker
npm run db:up

# Generate and run database migrations
npm run db:generate
npm run db:push

# Seed the database with sample products
npm run db:seed
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Ensure Docker is running
- Check that PostgreSQL is accessible at the configured port
- Verify DATABASE_URL in `.env` file

### AI Response Issues
- Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is valid and has sufficient credits
- Check network connectivity to OpenAI API
- Review the chat API endpoint logs

### Authentication Issues
- Ensure BETTER_AUTH_SECRET is set in `.env`

- Verify session storage in browser

## Production Deployment

1. Set up a production PostgreSQL database
2. Configure all environment variables
3. Set up proper authentication secrets
4. Configure your OpenAI API key
5. Deploy using your preferred hosting platform (Vercel, Railway, etc.)

## Security Notes

- The admin role is simplified for demo purposes (email-based)
- In production, implement proper role-based access control
